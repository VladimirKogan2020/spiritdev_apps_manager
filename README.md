# spiritdev_apps_manager
Spiritdev Apps Manager is a demo project to demonstrate the interaction between a RESTful web service and a rich client application. 

The server was built with ASP.NET Core 3.1, the client with Angular 9. 

The client application communicates with the server via CRUD operations (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE). DTO objects are used to exchange data between client and server. 

Features of the client app: Angular 9, RxJS, NGXS, Angular Material and Angular Flex. 

Features of the server app: ASP.NET Core 3.1, Entity Framework. 

The client application was developed with Visual Studio code. A proxy server was used to test the communication during development. To start the demo app, open the application with Visual Studio code and start the app with the command 'npm start'. This ensures that certain remaining calls are forwarded to the ASP.NET server via the proxy server. 

The server application was developed with Visual Studio 2019 (Community Edition). The server should start without problems from the IDE.
